Wheat Irrigation Tips

Optimal Timing: Irrigate wheat during the critical growth stagesâ€”crown root initiation (21-30 days after sowing), tillering, jointing, flowering, and grain filling. Avoid over-irrigation during the germination phase to prevent waterlogging.



Water Requirement: Wheat typically requires 450-500 mm of water during its growing season, depending on soil type and climate. Sandy soils need more frequent irrigation (every 10-12 days), while loamy soils can be irrigated every 15-20 days.



Irrigation Method: Use furrow or drip irrigation for efficient water use. Avoid flood irrigation to minimize water wastage and soil erosion.



Amount per Session: Apply 5-7 cm of water per irrigation session, ensuring the root zone is adequately moistened without excess runoff.



Monitoring: Use soil moisture sensors or the "feel and look" method to determine irrigation needs. Irrigate when the top 50-60 cm of soil feels dry.



Regional Considerations: In Kenya, irrigate during dry spells in the long rains (March-May) or short rains (October-December) if rainfall is insufficient. Adjust based on local weather patterns.
